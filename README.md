# mini-cake
A minimalistic Cake/Rake/Make implementation written in CoffeeScript, based on [this presentation by Jim Weirich](https://youtu.be/0D3KfnbTdWw?list=LLTbuuDV8WpBTY-4SbLJ3rBg&t=1174)

This was supposed to be just a quick experiment, not something actually useful.

I wanted to see how close I could get to Jim's ruby implementation, but in CoffeeScript. With only 26 lines of code, I'm pretty satisfied. :)

To run it, use this command:

```
$ coffee mini-cake.coffee make_mac_and_cheese
```

Or:

```
$ npm install
$ node . make_mac_and_cheese
```
